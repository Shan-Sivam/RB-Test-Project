# Tasks Completed
1. Added unit tests for the controller, service and repository
2. Slight change in the inMemoryRepository to expose the private field to make it testable
3. Added Moq, Fluent Assertions and Swagger to the dependencies.

# Notes
1. Assumed the new customer is added/updated with an existing address entity, so I haven't made changes to the address repostiories or services.
2. The solution can be broken down into multiple components.
